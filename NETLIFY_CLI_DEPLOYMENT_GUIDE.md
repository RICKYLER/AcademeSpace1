# Netlify CLI Deployment Guide

## ‚úÖ Netlify CLI Successfully Installed

**Version**: `netlify-cli/23.1.4`
**Status**: Ready to deploy your frontend application

## Quick Deployment Commands

### 1. Login to Netlify (First Time Only)
```bash
netlify login
```
This will open your browser to authenticate with Netlify.

### 2. Deploy Your Frontend Application

#### Option A: Production Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

#### Option B: Preview Deployment (Test First)
```bash
netlify deploy --dir=dist
```

## Step-by-Step Deployment Process

### Step 1: Authenticate
```bash
# Run this command in your terminal
netlify login
```
- Browser will open
- Sign in to your Netlify account
- Authorize the CLI

### Step 2: Deploy Your Built Application
```bash
# Deploy to production immediately
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

**What this does:**
- `--prod`: Deploys to production (live site)
- `--dir=dist`: Specifies your built frontend folder
- Creates a new site or updates existing one

### Step 3: Get Your Live URL
After deployment, you'll see:
```
‚úî Finished hashing 12 files
‚úî CDN requesting 10 files
‚úî Finished uploading 10 assets
‚úî Deploy is live!

Logs:              https://app.netlify.com/sites/your-site/deploys/abc123
Unique Deploy URL: https://abc123--your-site.netlify.app
Website URL:       https://your-site.netlify.app
```

## Advanced CLI Commands

### Initialize Site (Optional)
```bash
# Create netlify.toml and link to existing site
netlify init
```

### Check Deployment Status
```bash
# View recent deployments
netlify status

# View site info
netlify sites:list
```

### Environment Variables (If Needed)
```bash
# Set environment variables via CLI
netlify env:set VITE_API_KEY "your-api-key"

# List environment variables
netlify env:list
```

### Open Deployed Site
```bash
# Open your live site in browser
netlify open

# Open Netlify dashboard
netlify open:admin
```

## Deployment Workflow

### For Regular Updates
1. **Make changes** to your code
2. **Build your project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
3. **Deploy updated build**:
   ```bash
   netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
   ```

### For Testing Before Production
1. **Deploy to preview**:
   ```bash
   netlify deploy --dir=dist
   ```
2. **Test the preview URL**
3. **Deploy to production** if satisfied:
   ```bash
   netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
   ```
